h1. Loadtest tool

Tool could be used to test load your web application using different scenarios. Scripts are written in groovy using special test environment.

h2. Run

Copy one loadtest-1.0.jar and Example*.groovy from repository to one of directories on your computer. Use java to run it from commandline:

java -jar loadtest-1.0.jar Example1.groovy

h2. Environment

For groovy scripts following classes avialable: HTTP and Variations. HTTP class could be used to create load. Variation helps to create non-deterministic behavior. Look groovy documentation and src/main/resources/org/loadtest/Classes.groovy for details.

h3. Variations


h4. select(prob1, closure1, prob2, closure2, prob3, closure3, ...)


Select one of the closures to execute depending on probability. Probabilites could be not normalized: i.e. sum(prob~i~) != 1.0


h4. any(arguments...);


Select one of arguments with equal probability.


h3. HTTP


h4. get([Closure reporter, ]String ...urls)


Gets value of one(!randomly selected) of urls and reads line by line calling reporter(line). If reporter is not specified returns array of strings - lines of this file.


h4. parse(Pattern regex, String ...html)


Process text throught regular expression and selects regular expression groups. Returns 2-d array if several groups used and 1-d if one.


h4. resolve(String url, String path)


Resolves path relative to url.
